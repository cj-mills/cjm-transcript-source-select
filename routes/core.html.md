## State Management Helpers

These helpers provide typed access to the selection step state in route
handlers and duplicate audio source prevention.

## Queue Response Builder

Shared response builder for handlers that mutate the selection queue.
Covers three patterns:

- **Pattern A** (default): queue + OOB stats + conditional OOB source
  list
- **Pattern B** (`include_stats=False, include_source_list=False`):
  queue only
- **Pattern C** (`include_stats=False`): queue + conditional OOB source
  list
